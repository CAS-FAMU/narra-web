          p FAMU's CAS (Center for Audiovisual Studies) is an art school within a film school. Our department teaches a range of courses for those wanting to create moving image works 'beyond cinema". Video installation and interactive works, locative and mobile media, code based projects, conceptual artworks, multi-channel and multi-threaded sound and image practice, experimental documentary, and expanded to database cinema are some of the areas that our 30 some students work in while pusuing Bachelor and Master’s degrees.
          p Our facilities include a black box theater with a 12 channel sound system and the ability to project around the entire room and a Virtual Reality CAVE environment, both at our dedicated Institute for Intermedia; full sound and image editing suites, and of course a range of computers, cameras, projectors and equipment. Our main campus is in the Lazansky Palace across the street from the National Theater in the heart of Prague.
          p Staff teach the theoretical and historical underpinnings of contemporary new/inter-media practices as well as providing hands on classes in tools and techniques.
          p Development is taking place at the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague as part of the project "ON (Open Narrative 1.0)" and "NARRA 1.0" with the support of the Institutional Endowment for the Long Term Conceptual Development of Research Institutes, as provided by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic in 2013 and 2014.

          p NARRA stems originally from the playListNetWork project developed by Eric Rosenzveig and Willy LeMaitre and other media artists and programmers in 2002-03. The project was comprised of three parts: playListNetWork software developed in consultation with the artists, the audio visual media content work made with the software and an interface to visualize and navigate the authored structure.
          p playListNetWork: was an opensource, distributed video editing database that allows multiple users in different locations to simultaneously annotate media clips and edit branching playlists and include textual annotation. 
          p disPlayList: was the public view and interface for a streaming media work authored with the playListNetWork software. It was a web application embedded in a browser using various plugins to display the media. As an interface it was used to visualize the multi-threaded playlists and provide 3D navigation through their structure based on keyword or keyframe choices by the viewer.
          p Ressemblage: The first work created using the software, Ressemblage wass the result of a group of artist's conversation using media. It makes manifest a world that is an extension of the premises and concepts embedded in the design of the software.
          p Open Narrative Structures was a theoretical and practical class taught at FAMU’s Center for Audiovisual Studies department in 2010/11, 2012/13 and 2013/14 by artist Eric Rosenzveig and editor Tomas Doruska. The class presented their results in New Dlehi at SARAI Reader ‘09 in the form of an improvised AV performance, a talk and installation; and at Prague’s GAMU gallery in the form of an installation in June 2013.
          p DKR grant in 2013 allowed us to develop a framework for the softtware. Work in continuing in 2014 and 2015 with the collaboration of the software department of…

        .col-md-9
          p Artists can tell stories together using video. Instead of a linear narrative, media works can have multiple paths, multiple versions. The software can be used to create, visualiize and navigate  a tree of linked stories. Software as a tool for collaborative storytelling.
          p Video editors faced with hundreds of hours of material can annotate their media objects and then organize it based on complex search categories. The software itself will use existing software libraries to add functionality and perform automated annotations. For example the software can extract spoken words and make them into attached text; list shot size, geographic location, etc. Software as an editing tool.
          p Social scientists using video in their research need extensive annotation capabilities. Once there is a certain amount of textual data attached to the video, our software can apply external searches, on the internet, for example or through journals seeking out and selecting, in real time associated information to be displayed along with the original media objects. Our software can be used to search through a research project's media and show the resulting video and attached texts including citations, uses, notes or public comments. Software as a tool for audiovisual scholarship.
          p Narra is focussed on visualization of information. Therefore it can be used with standard archival databases (we have chosen Collective Access initially) and can then sort and organize existing collections and display and provide access to the results visually. Software to show and stream video from an existing database in a www browser.
